# CardGame
Card Game program that my professor made me program.
This is the improved version that I submitted to him because this program uses gradle and lombok libraries.
The program is made from java and generates a deck of cards, shuffles the deck, deals 5 cards to two seperate hands and displays those hands to the user using the console.
